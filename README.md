# RIFA-competing-website
This is my RIFA website. I made it for the competition. I really hope what I worked on is capable of doing well and maybe even winning the competition.
My name is Joseph Walker and I go to Trinity Christian Academy. I took coding this semester because I was interested in learning it. When I found out we were going to be making websites, I was so excited. I wanted to make the website with my best friend (little did I know I would be doing most of the work). While working on the website, I found out that I loved coding. There's something satisfying about looking at a website and being able to say, "I did that." Before I made the website, I had to draw a wireframe. And because I also love art, It was really fun. I also take pride in the name of our team, so I made sure to identify it in the website. Rifa has always been a placed I enjoyed going to and help serve the homeless. I hope the website that I made will help promote it. I discovered that I really enjoy coding and hope that this website is the beginning of my future in coding.
